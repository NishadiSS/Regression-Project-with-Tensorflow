# Regression Task with TensorFlow

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform regression tasks using TensorFlow. The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a regression model to predict continuous values based on input features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess dataset for regression.
- **Model Building:** Define and compile a regression model using TensorFlow.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (optional for additional metrics)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
